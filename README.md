Implementation of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe (essentially a tic-tac-toe game where each square is its own mini game) in Java for my APCS semester 1 final project. I'm sure you can find many explanations of the rules online. The one difference in my version is that after one player gets 3 in a row, the other player is allowed to pick any square for their next move.

For an example of a turn, see [SampleTurn.mp4](SampleTurn.mp4):

You can try it at the following link: https://replit.com/@jRaffill/ultimate-tic-tac-toe, although repl.it unfortunately runs very slowly to the point where I had to drastically reduce the AI simulation numbers in order to get the demo even playable, so the AI doesn't really work in the online version -- if you really want you should run it yourself to get the proper difficulty.
