Implementation of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe (essentially a tic-tac-toe game where each square is its own mini game) in Java for my APCS semester 1 final project. I'm sure you can find many explanations of the rules online. The one difference in my version is that after one player gets 3 in a row, the other player is allowed to pick any square for their next move.

For an example of a turn, see [SampleTurn.mp4](SampleTurn.mp4):
